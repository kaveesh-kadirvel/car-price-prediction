# 🚗 Car Price Prediction - ML Project

This project predicts the selling price of a car based on various features using Machine Learning techniques. It is designed as a supervised regression problem and uses Python with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib for data handling, training, and visualization.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given a dataset containing information about used cars, the goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the *selling price* of a car using features such as:

* Selling Price
* Year of Manufacture
* Kilometers Driven
* Fuel Type
* Seller Type
* Transmission
* Owner

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes:

* Numerical and categorical features
* Target: Selling_Price

The data was preprocessed by:

* Handling categorical values (e.g., encoding fuel and transmission types)
* Calculating car age from manufacturing year
* Removing outliers and checking feature correlations

## 🧠 ML Algorithms Used

* Linear Regression
The models are evaluated using:

* R² Score
* MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
* Cross-validation

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Akshu121796/CarPricePrediction.git
cd CarPricePrediction


2. Install dependencies:
